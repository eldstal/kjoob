Game(s) for an experimental 4-way display device

# The hardware
The game is meant to run simultaneously on four monitors, possibly running on different devices.
The monitors are set up in a square configuration around a table, resembling a cube with screens along the outside.

Each running instance of the game is associated with a monitor, referred to by its direction (North, East, South or West).

One instance is the "master", which handles user input and controls the other three.
